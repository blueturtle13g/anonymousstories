# anonymousstories
this project was supposed impove my skills in golang and level up from beginner to a fullstack web developer.
in this website users could log in and post their written and feedback from other book lovers and improve their writing skills.
they can rate and comment on each other's stories and comments, make categories and tags.
each rate to a single story will affect on its category and its writer.
this site also has charts that will show top categories, writers and stories.
it's worth to mention that I'm not very good at designing so it doesn't look really appealing, the main purpose was the
functionality that it should implement.
